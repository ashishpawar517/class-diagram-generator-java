## About
I wanted to build an utility app to create UML Class diagrams from java code. But didn't wanted to spend so much to draw it. So, I created this project using annotations `@SuperClass` and `@ChildClass` above the class declaration, project will create new mermaid markdown code for UML class diagrams.
